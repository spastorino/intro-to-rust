# Intro to Rust

This is an intro OSS workshop about the Rust programming language.
The workshop walks you around syntax, construction and main concepts
like ownership and borrowing.

Feel free to reuse this workshop :).

## TODO

- Come up with a better idea of how to introduce ownership concepts in
  particular on "Manual" memory management in Rust slide
- Add speakers notes to explain the intention of each slide better
- Tidy up markup and css, it's too untidy right now
