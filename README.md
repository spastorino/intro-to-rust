# Intro to Rust

This is an intro OSS workshop about the Rust programming language.
The workshop walks you around syntax, construction and main concepts
like ownership and borrowing.

Feel free to reuse this workshop :).

## TODO

- Add speakers notes to explain the intention of each slide better
- Tidy up markup and css, it's too untidy right now
